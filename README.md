# Ionic UI Component         

This GitHub repository is a part of my learning journey of Ionic Framework. The documentation is good, but the sample code for Vanilla JS is not so helpful, because I am using it only for Vanilla JS. However, the documentation is exactly for someone who use Ionic with Angular, React or Vue.
